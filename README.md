## 🚀 Getting Started locally

This project requires a backend component (yt-dlp), so it cannot be hosted on Vercel's free tier directly without Docker. Here is how to run it on your machine.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
2.  **FFmpeg** installed on your system path.
3.  **Python** (required by yt-dlp).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/edvincodes/wavepipe.git](https://github.com/edvincodes/wavepipe.git)
    cd wavepipe
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    # or npm install
    ```

3.  **CRITICAL STEP:** Download the engine.
    - Create a folder named `bin` in the root directory.
    - Download the latest [yt-dlp.exe](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) (for Windows) or binary (for Linux/Mac).
    - Place it inside the `/bin` folder.

4.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
